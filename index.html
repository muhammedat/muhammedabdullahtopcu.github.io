<h2 style="color:red;font-family:Times New Roman"><b>Life</b></h2>
<p style="font-family:Times New Roman">John McCarthy, known for his work on artificial intelligence, was born in Boston, Massachusetts, U.S., September 4, 1927. He graduated two years early from Belmont High School for he was extremely intelligent. John had a great talent in mathematics. He learned college mathematics by himself.  For these talent, John was able to skip the first two tears of mathematics when was accepted, in1944,  into California Institute of Technology. He completed his Ph.D. in Mathematics from Princeton University in 1951. Throughout his life he was married three times, John's last marriage was with Carolyn Talcott who a computer scientist at Stanford(Figure.1). When he was 84 years old, he died in Stanford, California, October 24, 2011. In addition, he came to the best places thanks to his mathematical intelligence throughout his life.</p>

<h2 style="color:red;font-family:Times New Roman"><b>Career as Computer Scientist</b></h2>
<p style="font-family:Times New Roman">John has worked as professor at Princeton, Standford University, Dartmouth and MIT. Actually, he usually deal with artificial intellegence. Even he organized the first international conference for the importance of A.I. in 1956. In addition, John took part in the committee designed ALGOL programming language. In the late 1950s, he inevented Lisp for reasoning about the use of recursion equations. After the invention of the Lisp programming language, it became one of the most important programming language for A.I. applications. McCarthy and his team at Stanford wrote a chess games in 1966(Figure.2). In this games Johnâ€™s team lost two  games and won two games.</p>
